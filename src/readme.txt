========================


OVERVIEW
--------

Based on concepts in the original CSSFriendly project, developed by Microsoft
and Russ Helfand and managed as an open-source project by Brian DeMarzo,
this project will provide an alternate set of control adapters that render 
your ASP.Net controls using well-documented semantic HTML and CSS.
